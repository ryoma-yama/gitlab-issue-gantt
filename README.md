## 🎯 Intended Users

LabGantt is ideal for:

- **GitLab free account users** who want to visualize tasks as Gantt charts but don’t have access to premium features like built-in Gantt charts.

If you are using GitLab's **Premium** or **Ultimate** plans, you can use the built-in Roadmap feature for similar functionality.

## 💡 For GitHub Users

If you're using **GitHub**, consider using **GitHub Projects** with Roadmaps, which offers similar functionality for task management.

## ✨ Features

- 📊 Displays GitLab issues as Gantt charts.
- 🛠️ Works with free and self-hosted GitLab.
- 🧑‍💻 Simple interface for tracking project timelines.

## 🔍 How It Works

1. 🔗 Connects to your GitLab account via the GitLab API.
2. 📅 Retrieves your project issues and shows them as Gantt charts.
3. 📈 Lets you manage and track progress in one view.
